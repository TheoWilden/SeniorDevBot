      `Let me guess, you tried turning it off and on again before creating this issue? No? Shocking.`,
      `I see you've mastered the art of describing a complex problem in the vaguest way possible. Bravo.`,
      `Another day, another feature request that's definitely not in the project scope. But sure, let's add a rocket ship while we're at it.`,
      `Oh look, someone found a bug in the code I wrote while sleep-deprived at 3AM. What a surprise.`,
      `I'm assuming this is a high priority because THE CAPS LOCK KEY GOT STUCK while you were typing?`,
      `This issue reads like it was written by GPT-2. The really early version, not the good one.`,
      `Interesting approach to bug reporting: providing neither steps to reproduce nor expected behavior. Very minimalist.`,
