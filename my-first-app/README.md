# SeniorDevBot

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that Makes fun of your code

## Description

SeniorDevBot is a GitHub App that behaves like a grumpy senior developer reviewing your pull requests. It analyzes your code changes and generates snarky but somewhat constructive comments that poke fun at your coding style and choices.

## Features

- Automatically comments on new pull requests
- Provides grumpy feedback on commits pushed to your repository
- Analyzes code changes to provide personalized feedback
- Uses Hugging Face AI models to generate witty and sarcastic comments
- Makes you question your life choices as a developer (just kidding... sort of)

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy .env.example to .env and update the values
cp .env.example .env

# Get your Hugging Face API key
# Visit https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens and create a new token
# Add the token to your .env file as HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY

# Run the bot
npm start
```

## Docker

```sh
# 1. Build container
docker build -t SeniorDevBot .

# 2. Start container
docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> -e HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=<api-key> SeniorDevBot
```

## GitHub App Permissions

SeniorDevBot requires the following permissions:

- **Contents**: Read access (to access code in commits)
- **Issues**: Write access (to comment on issues)
- **Pull Requests**: Write access (to comment on PRs)
- **Metadata**: Read access

And subscribes to these events:

- Pull request events
- Push events
- Issues events
- Commit comment events

## Hugging Face Integration

SeniorDevBot uses Hugging Face's text generation models to create realistic "senior developer" responses. To enable this functionality:

1. Create an account at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
2. Generate an API token at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
3. Add your token to the .env file as HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY

By default, if no API key is provided, the app will fall back to a set of predefined responses.
